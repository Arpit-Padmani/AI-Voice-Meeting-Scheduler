## üöÄ Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Voice-Based Commands**  
  > Example: ‚ÄúSchedule my meeting with Raj on 14th July at 8 PM‚Äù  
  ‚Üí Automatically schedules a calendar event with title, date, and time.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: User gives a voice command.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Extracts date, time, and title.
3. **Google Calendar API**: Event is created in your calendar.
4. **Reminder Handling**: Asks if a reminder should be set.
5. **Notification Scheduler**: Displays a system notification before the event.

 

## üîß Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arpit-Padmani/AI-Voice-Meeting-Scheduler.git
cd AI-Voice-Meeting-Scheduler
````

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

### üîë Google Calendar API Setup

To enable calendar access and event scheduling:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the **Google Calendar API**.
4. Go to **Credentials**:

   * Click **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **OAuth Client ID**.
   * Choose **Desktop App**.
   * Download the file and rename it to `credentials.json`.
5. Place `credentials.json` in the **root directory** of the project.

### üìÅ Required Files and Folders

* `credentials.json`
  ‚Üí Contains the client ID and secret to access the Google Calendar API.

* `token.json`
  ‚Üí Auto-generated after the first successful login and stores your access token.
  **Do not delete this file** unless you want to re-authenticate.

* `.env` *(Optional)*
  If you wish to manage environment-specific settings (e.g., default reminder time), you can use an `.env` file.

#### Example `.env`:

```env
DEFAULT_REMINDER_MINUTES=10
USE_DESKTOP_NOTIFICATION=true
```

 

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
python ai_voice_meeting_scheduler.py
